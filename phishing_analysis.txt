     ## Suspicious Signs
     - Sender looks fake: "support@official-bankofamerica.com" isn’t the real bank domain (should be bankofamerica.com).
     - Bad link: "https://bank-of-america-login-sec.com/verify" is not a trusted site.
     - Urgent words: "URGENT ACTION REQUIRED" and "permanent suspension" try to rush you.
     - Suspicious attachment: "account_update.zip" could contain malware.
     - Grammar error: "dont miss" (missing apostrophe) suggests a phishing attempt.

     ## Summary
