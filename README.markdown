# Cybersecurity Internship Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis

**Author**: Neel Bhatt  
**Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Repository**: Cybersecurity-Task2

## Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze a phishing email sample to identify suspicious characteristics that indicate a phishing attempt.

## Tools Used
- **Text Editor (nano)**: Used to create and edit the phishing email sample and analysis report.
- **Manual Inspection**: Checked the email for phishing signs like sender address, links, and urgent language.

## Steps Performed
1. **Created a Sample Email**:
   - Wrote a dummy phishing email and saved it as `phishing_email.txt` to simulate a suspicious email.
2. **Analyzed the Sender**:
   - Examined the "From" address to check if it looks fake or spoofed.
3. **Identified Suspicious Links**:
   - Looked for and noted any links that donâ€™t match trusted domains.
4. **Checked for Urgent Language**:
   - Reviewed the email body for words creating a sense of urgency or threat.
5. **Documented Findings**:
   - Recorded all observations in `phishing_analysis.txt` for submission.

## Files Included
- **`phishing_email.txt`**: A sample phishing email created for analysis.
- **`phishing_analysis.txt`**: A report detailing the phishing indicators found in the sample email.
- **`README.md`**: This file, explaining the task process and deliverables.

## Key Learnings
- Learned to spot phishing signs like fake sender addresses and suspicious links.
- Understood how urgent language is used to trick people (social engineering).
- Gained practice in documenting security findings clearly.

## Challenges and Resolutions
- **Challenge**: No real email with headers was available due to time constraints.
  - **Resolution**: Used a dummy email and focused on visible phishing signs instead.

## Future Improvements
- Explore real email samples with headers using tools like MXToolbox.
- Learn to analyze email headers for deeper insights.
- Practice creating more complex phishing scenarios.

## Acknowledgments
- **Elevate Cybersecurity Internship**: For providing this learning opportunity.
- **Neel Bhatt**: For completing the task under time pressure and documenting the process.
